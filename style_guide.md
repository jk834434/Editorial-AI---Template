This is a list of writing and formatting conventions typical of AI chatbots such as ChatGPT, with real examples taken from Wikipedia articles and drafts. It is a field guide to help detect undisclosed AI-generated content on Wikipedia. This list is descriptive, not prescriptive; it consists of observations, not rules. Advice about formatting or language to avoid in Wikipedia articles can be found in the policies and guidelines and the Manual of Style, but does not belong on this page.

This list is not a ban on certain words, phrases, or punctuation. Not all text featuring these indicators is AI-generated, as the large language models that power AI chatbots are trained on human writing, including the writing of Wikipedia editors. This is simply a catalog of very common patterns observed over many thousands of instances of AI-generated text, specific to Wikipedia. While some of its advice may be broadly applicable, some signs—particularly those involving punctuation and formatting—may not apply in a non-Wikipedia context.

The patterns here are also only potential signs of a problem, not the problem itself. While many of these issues are immediately obvious and easy to fix—e.g., excessive boldface, poor use of language and punctuation, broken markup, citation style quirks—they can point to less outwardly visible problems that carry much more serious policy risks. If LLM-generated text is polished enough (initially or subsequently), those surface defects might not be present, but deeper problems can be. Please do not merely treat these signs as the problems to be fixed; that could just make detection harder. The actual problems are those deeper concerns, so make sure to address them, either yourself or by flagging them, per the advice on handling suspected LLM-generated content and the WikiProject AI Cleanup Guide.

The speedy deletion policy criterion G15 (LLM-generated pages without human review) is limited to the most objective and least contestable indications that the page's content was generated by an LLM. There are three such indicators, the first of which can be found in the section regarding communication intended for the user and the other two in the citations section. The other signs are not sufficient on their own for speedy deletion.

Do not solely rely on artificial intelligence content detection tools (such as GPTZero) to evaluate whether text is LLM-generated. While they perform better than might be achieved by chance, these tools have non-trivial error rates and cannot replace human judgment. Detectors can be brittle to multiple factors such as text modifications (e.g. paraphrasing and spacing changes) and the use of generative models not seen during detector training. By the same token, do not trust too much in your own interpretation. Research shows that people who use LLMs heavily themselves can correctly determine whether an article was generated by AI about 90% of the time, which means that if you are an expert user of LLMs and you tag 10 pages as being AI-generated, you've probably falsely accused one editor. People who don't personally use LLMs much do only slightly better than random chance (in both directions) for identifying AI-generated articles.

### Statistical regression to the mean

LLMs (and artificial neural networks in general) use statistical algorithms to guess (infer) what should come next based on a large corpus of training material. It thus tends to regress to the mean; that is, the result tends toward the most statistically likely result that applies to the widest variety of cases. It can simultaneously be a strength and a "tell" for detecting AI-generated content.

For example, LLMs are usually trained on data from the internet in which famous people are generally described with positive, important-sounding language. Consequently, the LLM tends to omit specific, unusual, nuanced facts (which are statistically rare) and replace them with more generic, positive descriptions (which are statistically common). Thus the highly specific "inventor of the first train-coupling device" might become "a revolutionary titan of industry." It is like shouting louder and louder that a portrait shows a uniquely important person, while the portrait itself is fading from a sharp photograph into a blurry, generic sketch. The subject becomes simultaneously less specific and more exaggerated.

This statistical regression to the mean, a smoothing over of specific facts into generic statements, that could equally apply to many topics, makes AI-generated content easier to detect.

### Undue emphasis on symbolism, legacy, and importance

Words to watch: stands/serves as, is a testament/reminder, plays a vital/significant/crucial/pivotal role, underscores/highlights its importance/significance, impactful, important to social cohesion, reflects broader, symbolizing its ongoing/enduring/lasting impact, key turning point, promotes collaboration, indelible mark, deeply rooted, profound heritage, revolutionary, reinforces good habits, healthy relationship, steadfast dedication, 

LLM writing often puffs up the importance of the subject matter by adding statements about how arbitrary aspects of the topic represent or contribute to a broader topic. There is a distinct and easily identifiable repertoire of ways that it writes these statements.

  * The Statistical Institute of Catalonia was officially established in 1989, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of regional statistics in Spain. 
  * The founding of Idescat represented a significant shift toward regional statistical independence, enabling Catalonia to develop a statistical system tailored to its unique socio-economic context. This initiative was part of a broader movement across Spain to decentralize administrative functions and enhance regional governance.
  * Kumba has long been an important center for trade and agriculture.  The establishment of road networks connecting Kumba to other parts of the Southwest Region, such as Mamfe and Buea, helped solidify its role as a regional hub.

LLMs may include these statements for even the most mundane of subjects like etymology or population data. Sometimes, they add hedging preambles acknowledging that the subject is relatively unimportant or low-profile, before talking about its importance anyway.

**Examples**

  * During the Spanish colonial period, the name Bakunutan was hispanized to Bacnotan, a modification reflected in official documents preserved in the National Archives in Manila. This etymology highlights the enduring legacy of the community's resistance and the transformative power of unity in shaping its identity.
  * Though it saw only limited application, it contributes to the broader history of early aviation engineering and reflects the influence of French rotary designson German manufacturers.

When talking about biology (e.g., when asked to discuss an animal or plant species), LLMs tend to over-emphasize connections to the broader ecosystem or environment, even when those connections are tenuous or generic. LLMs also tend to belabor the species' conservation status and research and preservation efforts, even if the status is unknown and no serious efforts exist.

**Examples**

  * It plays a role in the ecosystem and contributes to Hawaii's rich cultural heritage.  Preserving this endemic species is vital not only for ecological diversity but also for sustaining the cultural traditions connected to Hawaii’s native flora.
  * Currently, there is no specific conservation assessment for Lethrinops lethrinus by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, the general health of the Lake Malawi ecosystem is crucial for the survival of this and other endemic species. Factors such as overfishing, pollution, and habitat destruction could potentially impact their populations.

### Undue emphasis on notability, attribution, and media coverage

Words to watch: independent coverage, local/regional/national/[country name] media outlets, music/business/tech outlets, written by a leading expert, active social media presence

Similarly, LLMs act as if the best way to prove that a subject is notable is to hit readers over the head with claims of notability, often by listing sources that a subject has been covered in. They may or may not provide additional context as to what those sources have actually said about the subject, and often inaccurately attribute their own superficial analyses to the source. This is more common in text from newer AI tools (2025 or later).

Human-written press releases have of course also cited news clippings for decades, but LLMs specifically asked to write a Wikipedia article often echo the exact wording of Wikipedia's guidelines, such as "independent coverage."

**Examples**

  * She spoke about AI on CNN, and was featured in Vogue, Wired, Toronto Star, and other media.  Her insights have also been featured in *Wired*, *Refinery29*, and other prominent media outlets.
  * Her views have been cited in The New York Times, BBC, Financial Times, and The Hindu.
  * Its significance is documented in archived school event programs and regional press coverage, including the *Mesabi Daily News*, which regularly reviewed performances held there.

On Wikipedia specifically, LLMs often painstakingly emphasize their sources in the body text—even for trivial coverage, uncontroversial facts, or other situations where a human Wikipedia editor would be more likely to either provide an inline citation or no source at all.

**Examples**

  * The restaurant has also been mentioned in ABC News coverage relating toincidents in the surrounding precinct, underscoring its role as a well-known late-night venue in the city [of Adelaide].
  * In the United States, university-based incubators and accelerators have expanded alongside these centers; an official Library of Congress review found that 31.5% of SBA [Small Business Administration] Growth Accelerator Fund Competition winners from 2014–2016 were university-based programs.

In articles about people/entities who use social media, LLMs will often note that they "maintain an active social media presence" or something similar. This wording is particularly idiosyncratic to AI text and relatively uncommon on Wikipedia before \~2024.

  * The mall maintains a strong digital presence, particularly on Instagram, where it actively shares the latest updates and events. Forum Kochi has consistently demonstrated excellence in digital promotions, with high-quality, engaging, and impactful video content playing a key role in its outreach.

### Superficial analyses

Words to watch: ensuring , highlighting , emphasizing , reflecting , underscoring , showcasing , ensuring , conducive/tantamount/contributing to , cultivating , encompassing , aligns with , essentially/fundamentally is 

AI chatbots tend to insert superficial analysis of information, often in relation to its significance, recognition, or impact. This is often done by attaching a present participle ("-ing") phrase at the end of sentences, sometimes with vague attributions to third parties (see below).

While many of these words are strong AI tells on their own, an even stronger tell is when the subjects of these verbs are facts, events, or other inanimate things. A person, for example, can highlight or emphasize something, but a fact or event cannot. The "highlighting" or "underscoring" is not something that is actually happening; it is a claim by a disembodied narrator about what something means.

Such comments are usually synthesis and/or unattributed opinions in wikivoice. Newer chatbots with retrieval-augmented generation (for example, an AI chatbot that can search the web) may attach these statements to named sources—e.g., "Roger Ebert highlighted the lasting influence"—regardless of whether those sources say anything close.

**Examples**

  * Douera enjoys close proximity to the capital city, Algiers, further enhancing its significance as a dynamic hub of activity and culture.
  * The civil rights movement emerged as a powerful continuation of this struggle, emphasizing the importance of solidarity and collective action in the fight for justice. This historical legacy has influenced contemporary African-American families, shaping their values, community structures, and approaches to political engagement. Economically, the enduring impacts of systemic inequality have led to both challenges and innovations within African-American communities, driving a commitment to empowerment and social change that echoes through generations.
  * Its bilingual monument sign, with inscriptions in both English and Spanish, underscores its role in bringing together Latter-day Saints from the United States and Mexico.
  * These citations, spanning more than six decades and appearing in recognized academic publications, illustrate Blois' lasting influence in computational linguistics, grammar, and neology.
  * It holds a pivotal place in the East Central Railway Zone of Indian Railways, serving as a major railway hub with historical significance. The station has 1,676 mm (5 ft 6 in) broad gauge along with 8 tracks and 6 platforms.  Historically, it has been crucial for linking Darbhanga with significant cities like Delhi, Patna, and Kolkata, facilitating the movement of passengers and goods. The station has supported various services, including passenger trains and express trains like the Satyagrah Express and Mithila Express, contributing to the socio-economic development of the region.  Over the years, Darbhanga Junction has seen several upgrades and modernization efforts aimed at improving facilities and operational efficiency, reflecting its continued relevance in the regional and national transportation landscape.

### Promotional and advertisement-like language

Words to watch: continues to captivate, groundbreaking (in the figurative sense), stunning natural beauty, enduring/lasting legacy, nestled, in the heart of, boasts a 

LLMs have serious problems keeping a neutral tone, especially when writing about something that could be considered "cultural heritage"—in which case they constantly remind the reader of its importance.

**Examples**

  * Nestled within the breathtaking region of Gonder in Ethiopia, Alamata Raya Kobo stands as a vibrant town with a rich cultural heritage and a significant place within the Amhara region. From its scenic landscapes to its historical landmarks, Alamata Raya Kobo offers visitors a fascinating glimpse into the diverse tapestry of Ethiopia. In this article, we will explore the unique characteristics that make Alamata Raya Kobo a town worth visiting and shed light on its significance within the Amhara region.
  * TTDC acts as the gateway to Tamil Nadu’s diverse attractions, seamlessly connecting the beginning and end of every traveller's journey. It offers dependable, value-driven experiencesthat showcase the state’s rich history, spiritual heritage, and natural beauty.

In a similar way, LLM chatbots also add promotional/positive-sounding language to text about companies, business, and products, such that it sounds more like the transcript of a TV commercial.

  * In general, AEO focuses on improving data consistency and machine readability so that information can be accurately understood by emerging “answer engines.” Commonly discussed practices include using structured data formats such as JSON-LD and schema.org, maintaining the freshness and accuracy of published information, and aligning digital entities with open web standards like Wikidata and Schema.org.
  * The SOLLEI’s exterior design communicates a powerful emotional presence, staying true to Cadillac's signature bold proportions. Its low, elongated silhouette is highlighted by a wide stance and an extended coupe door, which enhances accessibility to the spacious rear cabin. Smooth, uninterrupted surfaces and a pronounced A-line accentuate the vehicle’s overall length, while a sleek, low tail imparts a sense of refined dynamism. A mid-body line runs seamlessly from the headlamps to the taillights, reinforcing the car’s cohesive and elegant design. Traditional door handles have been replaced with discrete buttons, preserving the vehicle’s clean and modern profile. In a nod to Cadillac’s legacy of bold color choices, the exterior is finished in "Manila Cream"—a distinctive hue originally offered in 1957 and 1958. This heritage color has been thoughtfully revived and hand-painted by Cadillac artisans, showcasing the brand’s dedication to craftsmanship and historical reverence.

### Didactic, editorializing disclaimers

Words to watch: it's important/critical/crucial to note/remember/consider, that said, may vary 

LLMs often tell the reader about things "it's important to remember." This frequently takes the form of "disclaimers" to an imagined reader regarding safety or controversial topics, or disambiguating topics that vary in different locales/jurisdictions.

**Examples**

  * The emergence of these informal groups reflects a growing recognition of the interconnected nature of urban issues and the potential for ANCs to play a role in shaping citywide policies. However, it's important to note that these caucuses operate outside the formal ANC structure and their influence on policy decisions may vary.
  * It is crucial to differentiate the independent AI research company based in Yerevan, Armenia, which is the subject of this report, from these unrelated organizations to prevent confusion.
  * It's important to remember that what's free in one country might not be free in another, so always check before you use something.

Words to watch: In summary, In conclusion, Overall 

When generating longer outputs (such as when told to "write an article"), LLMs often add a section titled "Conclusion" or similar, and will often end a paragraph or section by summarizing and restating its core idea.

**Examples**

  * In summary, the educational and training trajectory for nurse scientists typically involves a progression from a master's degree in nursing to a Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing, followed by postdoctoral training in nursing research. This structured pathway ensures that nurse scientists acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to engage in rigorous research and contribute meaningfully to the advancement of nursing science.

### Outline-like conclusions about challenges and future prospects

Words to watch: Despite its  faces several challenges , Despite these challenges, Challenges and Legacy, Future Outlook 

Many LLM-generated Wikipedia articles include a "Challenges" section, which typically begins with a sentence like "Despite its [positive/promotional words], [article subject] faces challenges " and ends with either a vaguely positive assessment of the article subject, or speculation about how ongoing or potential initiatives could benefit the subject. Such paragraphs usually appear at the end of articles with a rigid outline structure, which may also include a separate section for "Future Prospects."

Note: This sign is about the rigid formula, not simply the mention of challenges or challenging.

**Examples**

  * Despite its industrial and residential prosperity, Korattur faces challengestypical of urban areas, including  With its strategic location and ongoing initiatives, Korattur continues to thriveas an integral part of the Ambattur industrial zone, embodying the synergy between industry and residential living.
  * Despite its success, the Panama Canal faces challenges, including  Future investments in technology, such as automated navigation systems, and potential further expansions could enhance the canal’s efficiency and maintain its relevance in global trade.
  * Despite their promising applications, pyroelectric materials face several challenges that must be addressed for broader adoption. One key limitation is  Despite these challenges, the versatility of pyroelectric materials positions them as critical componentsfor sustainable energy solutions and next-generation sensor technologies.
  * The future of hydrocarbon economies faces several challenges, including  This section would speculate on potential developments and the changing landscape of global energy.
  * Operating in the current Afghan media environment presents numerous challenges, including  Despite these challenges, Amu TV has managed to continue to provide a vital service to the Afghan population​​.
  * For example, while the methodology supports transdisciplinary collaboration in principle, applying it effectively in large, heterogeneous teams can be challenging.  SCE continues to evolve in response to these challenges.

### Leads treating Wikipedia lists or broad article titles as proper nouns

In AI-generated articles about topics with a title that is not a proper name, such as a list, the first sentence of the lead may introduce and/or define the article's title as if it were a standalone real-world entity. While the Manual of Style does allow such titles to be included at the beginning of the lead "in a natural way"; these AI leads tend not to be so natural.

**Examples**

  * "The Effects of Foreign language anxiety on Learning" refers to the feelings of tension, nervousness, and apprehension experienced when learning or using a language other than one’s native tongue.
  * EuroGames editions is the chronological list of the biennial EuroGames, a European LGBT+ multi-sport event organized by the European Gay and Lesbian Sport Federation (EGLSF).
  * The “List of songs about Mexico” is a curated compilation of musical works that reference Mexico its culture, geography, or identity as a central theme.

### Language and grammar

#### Overused "AI vocabulary" words

Words to watch: align/aligns/aligning with, crucial, delve/delves/delving (pre-2025), emphasizing, enduring, enhance/enhances/enhancing, fostering, garnered/garnering, highlight/highlighted/highlighting/highlights (as a verb), interplay, intricate/intricacies, key (as an adjective), landscape (as an abstract noun), pivotal, showcase/showcased/showcases/showcasing, tapestry (as an abstract noun), testament, underscore/underscored/underscores/underscoring, vibrant

Many studies have demonstrated that LLMs overuse certain words – especially compared to pre-2022 text, which is almost certain to be human-written. These "AI vocabulary" words are also ubiquitous in AI-generated encyclopedias, such as Grokipedia, and in AI-generated Wikipedia text. They often co-occur in LLM output: where there is one, there are likely others. An edit introducing one or two of these words may not be a big deal, but an edit (post-2022) introducing lots of them, lots of times, is one of the strongest tells for AI use.

The distribution of "AI vocabulary" is slightly different depending on which chatbot or LLM was used, and has changed over time. For instance, the word delve was famously overused by ChatGPT until 2025, when its incidence dropped off sharply.

Please keep context in mind. For example, while the word "underscore" is overused in AI text, it can also refer to a literal underline mark, or to incidental music.

**Examples**

  * Somali cuisine is an intricate and diverse fusion of a multitude of culinary influences, drawing from the rich tapestry of Arab, Indian, and Italianflavours. This culinary tapestry is a direct result of Somalia's longstanding heritage of vibrant trade and bustling commerce. 
  * Additionally, a distinctive feature of Somali culinary tradition is the incorporation of camel meat and milk. They are considered a delicacy and serve as cherished and fundamental elements in the rich tapestry of Somali cuisine. 
  * An enduring testament to the influence of Italian colonial rule in Somalia is the widespread adoption of pasta and lasagne in the local culinary landscape, espicially in the south, showcasing how these dishes have integrated into the traditional diet alongside rice. 
  * Additionally, Somali merchants played a pivotal role in the global coffee trade, being one of the first to export coffee beans.

#### Negative parallelisms

Parallel constructions involving "not", "but", or "however" such as "Not only  but " or "It is not just about , it's " are common in LLM writing but are often unsuitable for writing in a neutral tone.

**Examples**

  * Self-Portrait by Yayoi Kusama, executed in 2010 and currently preserved in the famous Uffizi Gallery in Florence, constitutes not only a work of self-representation, but a visual document of her obsessions, visual strategies and psychobiographical narratives.
  * It’s not just about the beat riding under the vocals; it’s part of the aggression and atmosphere.

Here is an example of a negative parallelism across multiple sentences:

  * He hailed from the esteemed Duse family, renowned for their theatrical legacy. Eugenio's life, however, took a path that intertwined both personal ambition and familial complexities.

#### Outlines of negatives

AI-generated text sometimes contains constructions that may read something along the lines of "not , it's " or "no , no , just ".

**Examples**

  * You say these sources “cover multiple events”? False. They echo the same viral incident and do it through a limited lens. This isn’t WP:NBIO — it’s WP:1EVENT in disguise, trying to wear a press badge like armor.
    
    Now let’s talk BLP1E: This person is only in the news because of one isolated controversy. Not a career, not a body of work, not sustained relevance — just an algorithmic moment. And if we’re really upholding Wikipedia’s values, we don’t preserve pages built on the backs of virality alone, especially when it risks long-term harm to a living subject without lasting notability.
    “Might as well get back on topic.”
    Then let’s stay on topic, and the topic is not who feels warm fuzzies from visibility, it’s whether this article meets the threshold for inclusion. It doesn’t.
    And finally — if you don’t want “a wall of text,” maybe don’t build a wall of shallow logic and expect people not to knock it down. This ain’t bludgeoning — it’s surgical teardown of a weak argument hiding behind fake neutrality.

LLMs overuse the 'rule of three'. This can take different forms, from "adjective, adjective, adjective" to "short phrase, short phrase, and short phrase". LLMs often use this structure to make superficial analyses appear more comprehensive.

**Examples**

  * The Amaze Conference brings together global SEO professionals, marketing experts, and growth hackers to discuss the latest trends in digital marketing. The event features keynote sessions, panel discussions, and networking opportunities.

#### Vague attributions of opinion

Words to watch: Industry reports, Observers have cited, Experts argue, Some critics argue 

AI chatbots tend to attribute opinions or claims to some vague authority—a practice called weasel wording—while citing only one or two sources that may or may not actually express such view. They also tend to overgeneralize the perspective of one or few sources into that of a wider group.

**Examples**

  * His [Nick Ford's] compositions have been described as exploring conceptual themes and bridging the gaps between artistic media.
    — From Draft:Nick Ford (musician). Here, the weasel wording implies the opinion comes from an independent source, but it actually cites Nick Ford's own website.
  * Due to its unique characteristics, the Haolai River is of interest to researchers and conservationists. Efforts are ongoing to monitor its ecological health and preserve the surrounding grassland environment, which is part of a larger initiative to protect China’s semi-arid ecosystems from degradation.
  * The Kwararafa (Kororofa) confederacy is described in scholarship as a shifting Benue valley coalition led by Jukungroups and incorporating a range of Middle Belt peoples. Because much of the historical record derives from Hausachronicles, Bornu sources and oral tradition, modern researchers treatKwararafa as a fluid political and cultural formation rather than a fixed state. As a result, lists of member groups vary by period and source.

Generative AI has a repetition-penalty code, meant to discourage it from reusing words too often. For instance, the output might give a main character's name and then repeatedly use a different synonym or related term (e.g., protagonist, key player, eponymous character) when mentioning it again.

Note: If a user adds multiple pieces of AI-generated content in separate edits, this tell may not apply, as each piece of text may have been generated in isolation.

**Examples**

  * Vierny, after a visit in Moscow in the early 1970’s, committed to supporting artists resisting the constraints of socialist realism and discovered Yankilevskly, among others such as Ilya Kabakov and Erik Bulatov. In the challenging climate of Soviet artistic constraints, Yankilevsky, alongside other non-conformist artists, faced obstacles in expressing their creativityfreely. Dina Vierny, recognizing the immense talent and the struggle these artists endured, played a pivotal role in aiding their artistic aspirations. 
    In this new chapter of his life, Yankilevsky found himself amidst a community of like-minded artists who, despite diverse styles, shared a common goal—to break free from the confines of state-imposed artistic norms, particularly socialist realism. 
    The move to Paris facilitated an environment where Yankilevsky could further explore and exhibit his distinctive artistic vision without the constraints imposed by the Soviet regime. Dina Vierny's unwavering support and commitment to the Russian avant-garde artists played a crucial role in fostering a space where their creativity could flourish, contributing to the rich tapestry of artistic expression in the vibrant cultural landscape of Paris. Vierny's commitment culminated in the groundbreaking exhibition "Russian Avant-Garde - Moscow 1973" at her Saint-Germain-des-Prés gallery, showcasing the diverse yet united front of non-conformist artists challenging the artistic norms of their time.

When from  to  constructions are not used figuratively, they are used to indicate the lower and upper bounds of a scale. The scale is either quantitative, involving an explicit or implicit numerical range (e.g. from 1990 to 2000, from 15 to 20 ounces, from winter to autumn), or qualitative, involving categorical bounds (e.g. "from seed to tree", "from mild to severe", "from white belt to black belt"). The same constructions may be used to form a merism—a figure of speech that combines the two extremes as two contrasting parts of the whole to refer to the whole. This is a figurative meaning, but it has the same structure as the non-figurative usage, because it still requires an identifiable scale: from head to toe (the length of a body denoting the whole body), from soup to nuts(clearly based on time), etc. This is not a false range.

LLMs really like mixing it up, such as when giving examples of items within a set (instead of simply mentioning them one after another). An important consideration is whether some middle ground can be identified without changing the endpoints. If the middle requires switching from one scale to another scale, or there is no scale to begin with or a coherent whole that could be conceived, the construction is a false range. LLMs often employ "figurative" (often simply: meaningless) "from  to " constructions that purport to signify a scale, while the endpoints are loosely related or even unrelated things and no meaningful scale can be inferred. LLMs do this because such meaningless language is used in persuasive writing to impress and woo, and LLMs are heavily influenced by examples of persuasive writing during their training.

**Example**

  * Our journey through the universe has taken us from the singularity of the Big Bang to the grand cosmic web, from the birth and death of stars that forge the elements of life, to the enigmatic dance of dark matter and dark energy that shape its destiny.
     Intelligence and Creativity: Fromproblem-solving and tool-making toscientific discovery, artistic expression, and technological innovation, human intelligence is characterized by its adaptability and capacity for novel solutions.  Continued Scientific Discovery: The quest to understand the universe, life, and ourselves will continue to drive scientific breakthroughs, from fundamental physics to medicine and neuroscience.

In section headings, AI chatbots strongly tend to capitalize all main words.

**Examples**

  * Global Context: Critical Mineral Demand
    According to a 2023 report by Goldman Sachs, the global market for critical minerals 
  * Strategic Negotiations and Global Partnerships
    In 2014, Katalayi was appointed senior executive adviser to the chairman of the board of Gécamines 
  * High-Stakes Deals: Glencore, China, and Russia
    There was also interest from Moscow for strategic Congolese assets. 

### Excessive use of boldface

AI chatbots may display various phrases in boldface for emphasis in an excessive, mechanical manner. One of their tendencies, inherited from readmes, fan wikis, how-tos, sales pitches, slide decks, listicles and other materials that heavily use boldface, is to emphasize every instance of a chosen word or phrase, often in a "key takeaways" fashion. Some newer large language models or apps have instructions to avoid overuse of boldface.

**Examples**

  * It blends OKRs (Objectives and Key Results), KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), and visual strategy tools such as the Business Model Canvas (BMC) and Balanced Scorecard (BSC). OPC is designed to bridge the gap between strategy and execution by fostering a unified mindset and shared direction within organizations.
  * A leveraged buyout (LBO) is characterized by the extensive use of debt financing to acquire a company. This financing structure enables private equity firms and financial sponsors to control businesses while investing a relatively small portion of their own equity. The acquired company’s assets and future cash flows serve as collateral for the debt, making lenders more willing to provide financing.
  * 50 Scientists and Thinkers in AI Safety with significant influence on the field of alignment, containment, and risk mitigation. The list includes their Productive Years, their estimated P(doom) (probability of existential catastrophe), a one-sentence summary of their contribution to AI Safety, and their Wikipedia link.

AI chatbots output often includes vertical lists formatted in a specific way: an ordered or unordered list where the list marker (number, bullet, dash, etc.) is followed by an inline boldfaced header, separated with a colon from the remaining descriptive text.

Instead of proper wikitext, a bullet point in an unordered list may appear as a bullet character (•), hyphen (-), en dash (–), hash (\#), emoji, or similar character. Ordered lists (i.e. numbered lists) may use explicit numbers (such as 1.) instead of standard wikitext. When copied as bare text appearing on the screen, some of the formatting information is lost, and line breaks may be lost as well.

**Examples**

  * 1.  Historical Context Post-WWII Era: The world was rapidly changing after WWII,  2. Nuclear Arms Race: Following the U.S. atomic bombings, the Soviet Union detonated its first bomb in 1949,  3. Key Figures Edward Teller: A Hungarian physicist who advocated for the development of more powerful nuclear weapons,  4. Technical Details of Sundial Hydrogen Bomb: The design of Sundial involved a hydrogen bomb  5. Destructive Potential: If detonated, Sundial would create a fireball up to 50 kilometers in diameter,  6. Consequences and Reactions Global Impact: The explosion would lead to an apocalyptic nuclear winter,  7. Political Reactions: The U.S. military and scientists expressed horror at the implications of such a weapon,  8. Modern Implications Current Nuclear Arsenal: Today, there are approximately 12,000 nuclear weapons worldwide,  9. Key Takeaways Understanding the Madness: The concept of Project Sundial highlights the extremes of human ingenuity  10. Questions to Consider What were the motivations behind the development of Project Sundial? 
  * Conflict of Interest (COI)/Autobiography: While I understand the concern regarding my username 
    Notability (GNG and NPOLITICIAN): I have revised the article to focus on factual details 
    Original Research (WP) and Promotional Tone: I have worked on removing original research 
    Article Move to Main Namespace: Moving the draft to the main namespace after the AFC review 

AI chatbots love using emojis. In particular, they sometimes decorate section headings or bullet points by placing emojis in front of them. This is most noticeable in talkpage comments.

### Overuse of em dashes

While human editors and writers often like em dashes (—), AI loves them. LLM output uses them more often than nonprofessional human-written text of the same genre, and uses them in places where humans are more likely to use commas, parentheses, colons, or (misused) hyphens (-). LLMs especially tend to use em dashes in a formulaic, pat way, often mimicking "punched up" sales-like writing by over-emphasizing clauses or parallelisms.

This sign is most useful when taken in combination with other indicators, not by itself.

**Examples**

  * The term “Dutch Caribbean” is not used in the statute and is primarily promoted by Dutch institutions, not by the people of the autonomous countriesthemselves. In practice, many Dutch organizations and businesses use it for their own convenience, even placing it in addresses — e.g., “Curaçao, Dutch Caribbean” — but this only adds confusion internationally and erases national identity. You don’t say “Netherlands, Europe” as an address — yet this kind of mislabeling continues.
  * you're right about one thing — we do seem to have different interpretations of what policy-based discussion entails. 
    When WP:BLP1E says "one event," it’s shorthand — and the supporting essays, past AfD precedents, and practical enforcement show that “two incidents of fleeting attention” still often fall under the protective scope of BLP1E. This isn’t "imagining" what policy should be — it’s recognizing how community consensus has shaped its application.
    Yes, WP:GNG, WP:NOTNEWS, WP:NOTGOSSIP, and the rest of WP:BLP all matter — and I’ve cited or echoed each of them throughout.  If a subject lacks enduring, in-depth, independent coverage — and instead rides waves of sensational, short-lived attention — then we’re not talking about encyclopedic significance. 
     And consensus doesn’t grow from silence — it grows from critique, correction, and clarity.
    If we disagree on that, then yes — we’re speaking different languages.
  * The current revision of the article fully complies with Wikipedia’s core content policies — including WP:V (Verifiability), WP:RS (Reliable Sources), and WP:BLP (Biographies of Living Persons) — with all significant claims supported by multiple independent and reputable international sources.
     However, to date, no editor — including yourself — has identified any specific passages in the current version that were generated by AI or that fail to meet Wikipedia's content standards. 
    Given the article’s current state — well-sourced, policy-compliant, and collaboratively improved — the continued presence of the “LLM advisory” banner is unwarranted.

### Curly quotation marks and apostrophes

AI chatbots typically use curly quotation marks (“” or ‘’) instead of straight quotation marks ("" or ''). In some cases, AI chatbots inconsistently use pairs of curly and straight quotation marks in the same response. They also tend to use the curly apostrophe (’), the same character as the curly right single quotation mark, instead of the straight apostrophe ('), such as in contractions and possessive forms. They may also do this inconsistently.

Curly quotes alone do not prove LLM use. Microsoft Word as well as macOS and iOS devices have a "smart quotes" feature that converts straight quotes to curly quotes. Grammar correcting tools such as LanguageTool may also have such a feature. Curly quotation marks and apostrophes are common in professionally typeset works such as major newspapers. Citation tools like Citer may repeat those that appear in the title of a web page: for example,

McClelland, Mac (September 27, 2017). "When 'Not Guilty' Is a Life Sentence". The New York Times. Retrieved August 3, 2025.

Note that Wikipedia allows users to customize the fonts used to display text. Some fonts display matched curly apostrophes as straight, in which case the distinction is invisible to the user.

User messages and unblock requests generated by AI chatbots sometimes begin with text that is intended to be pasted into the Subject field on an email form.

**Examples**

  * Subject: Request for Permission to Edit Wikipedia Article - "Dog"
  * Subject: Request for Review and Clarification Regarding Draft Article

### Communication intended for the user

#### Collaborative communication

Words to watch: I hope this helps, Of course\!, Certainly\!, You're absolutely right\!, Would you like, is there anything else, let me know, more detailed breakdown, here is a 

Editors sometimes paste text from an AI chatbot that was meant as correspondence, prewriting or advice, rather than article content. This may appear in article text or within comments (\<-- --\>). Chatbots prompted to produce a Wikipedia article or comment may also explicitly state that the text is meant for Wikipedia, and may mention various policies and guidelines in the output—often explicitly specifying that they're Wikipedia's conventions.

**Examples**

  * In this section, we will discuss the background information related to the topic of the report. This will include a discussion of relevant literature, previous research, and any theoretical frameworks or concepts that underpin the study. The purpose is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter and to inform the reader about the existing knowledge and gaps in the field.
  * Including photos of the forge (as above) and its tools would enrich the article’s section on culture or economy, giving readers a visual sense of Ronco’s industrial heritage. Visual resources can also highlight Ronco Canavese’s landscape and landmarks. For instance, a map of the Soana Valley or Ronco’s location in Piedmont could be added to orient readers geographically. The village’s scenery  could be illustrated with an image. Several such photographs are available (e.g., on Wikimedia Commons) that show Ronco’s panoramic view,  Historical images, if any exist (such as early 20th-century photos of villagers in traditional dress or of old alpine trades), would also add depth to the article. Additionally, the town’s notable buildings and sites can be visually presented:  Including an image of the Santuario di San Besso  could further engage readers. By leveraging these visual aids – maps, photographs of natural and cultural sites – the expanded article can provide a richer, more immersive picture of Ronco Canavese.
  * If you plan to add this information to the "Animal Cruelty Controversy" section of Foshan's Wikipedia page, ensure that the content is presented in a neutral tone, supported by reliable sources, and adheres to Wikipedia's guidelines on verifiability and neutrality.

#### Knowledge-cutoff disclaimers and speculation about gaps in sources

Words to watch: as of [date], Up to my last training update, as of my last knowledge update, While specific details are limited/scarce, not widely available/documented/disclosed, in the provided/available sources/search results, based on available information 

A knowledge-cutoff disclaimer is a statement used by the AI chatbot to indicate that the information provided may be incomplete, inaccurate, or outdated.

If an LLM has a fixed knowledge cutoff (usually the model's last training update), it is unable to provide any information on events or developments past that time, and it often outputs a disclaimer to remind the user of this cutoff, which usually takes the form of a statement that says the information provided is accurate only up to a certain date.

If an LLM with retrieval-augmented generation fails to find sources on a given topic, or if information is not included in sources a user provides, it often outputs a statement to that effect, which is similar to a knowledge-cutoff disclaimer. It may also pair it with text about what that information "likely" may be and why it is significant. This information is entirely speculative (including the very claim that it's "not documented") and may be based on loosely related topics or completely fabricated.

**Examples**

  * While specific details about Kumarapediya's history or economy are not extensively documented in readily available sources, 
  * While specific information about the fauna of Studniční hora is limited in the provided search results, the mountain likely supports
  * Though the details of these resistance efforts aren't widely documented, they highlight her bravery
  * No significant public controversies or security incidents affecting Outpost24 have been documented as of June 2025.
  * As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I don't have specific information about the current status or developments related to the "Chester Mental Health Center" in today's era.
    Below is a detailed overview based on available information:

Words to watch: as an AI language model, as a large language model, I cannot offer medical advice, but I can, I'm sorry 

Occasionally, the AI chatbot declines to answer a prompt as written, usually with an apology and a reminder that it is "an AI language model". Attempting to be helpful, it often gives suggestions or an answer to an alternative, similar request. Outright refusals have become increasingly rare.

Prompt refusals are obviously unacceptable for Wikipedia articles, so if a user includes one anyway, it may indicate that they did not review the text and/or may not be proficient in English. Remember to assume good faith, because that editor may genuinely want to improve our coverage of knowledge gaps.

**Examples**

  * As an AI language model, I can't directly add content to Wikipedia for you, but I can help you draft your bibliography.

#### Phrasal templates and placeholder text

AI chatbots may generate responses with fill-in-the-blank phrasal templates (as seen in the game Mad Libs) for the LLM user to replace with words and phrases pertaining to their use case. However, some LLM users forget to fill in those blanks. Note that non-LLM-generated templates exist for drafts and new articles.

**Examples**

  * Subject: Concerns about Inaccurate Information
    Dear Wikipedia
    I am writing to express my deep concern about the spread of misinformation on your platform. Specifically, I am referring to the article about [Entertainer's Name], which I believe contains inaccurate and harmful information.
  * Subject: Edit Request for Wikipedia Entry
    Dear Wikipedia Editors,
    I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request an edit for the Wikipedia entry
    I have identified an area within the article that requires updating/improvement. [Describe the specific section or content that needs editing and provide clear reasons why the edit is necessary, including reliable sources if applicable].

Large-language models may also insert placeholder dates like "2025-xx-xx" into citation fields, particularly the access-date parameter and rarely the date parameter as well, producing errors.

**Examples**

  * `<ref>{{cite web |title=Canadian Screen Music Awards 2025 Winners and Nominees |url=URL |website=Canadian Screen Music Awards |date=2025 |access-date=2025-XX-XX }}</ref>`
  * `<ref>{{cite web |title=Best Original Score, Dramatic Series or Special – Winner: "Murder on the Inca Trail" |url=URL |website=Canadian Screen Music Awards |date=2025 |access-date=2025-XX-XX }}</ref>`
  * `<ref>{{cite web |title=Best Original Score for a Narrative Feature Film – Nominee: "Don't Move" |url=URL |website=Canadian Screen Music Awards |date=2025 |access-date=2025-XX-XX }}</ref>`
  * `<ref>{{cite web |title=Best Original Score for a Short Film – Nominee: "T. Rex" |url=URL |website=Canadian Screen Music Awards |date=2025 |access-date=2025-XX-XX }}</ref>`

Links to searches
"2022-xx-xx" OR "2024-xx-xx" OR "2025-xx-xx"

LLM-generated infobox edits may contain placeholder comments alongside unused fields, specifying that text or images should be added.

**Examples**

  * ` | leader_name =  `

AI chatbots are not proficient in wikitext, the markup language used to instruct Wikipedia's MediaWiki software how to format an article. As wikitext is a niche markup language, found mostly on wikis running on MediaWiki and other MediaWiki-based platforms like Miraheze, LLMs tend to lack wikitext-formatted training data. While the corpora of chatbots did ingest millions of Wikipedia articles, these articles would not have been processed as text files containing wikitext syntax. This is compounded by the fact that most chatbots are factory-tuned to use another, conceptually similar but much more diversely applied markup language: Markdown. Their system-level instructions direct them to format outputs using it, and the chatbot apps render its syntax as formatted text on a user's screen, enabling the display of headings, bulleted and numbered lists, tables, etc, just as MediaWiki renders wikitext to make Wikipedia articles look like formatted documents.

When asked about its "formatting guidelines", a chatbot willing to reveal some of its system-level instructions typically generates some variation of the following (this is Microsoft Copilot in mid-2025):

> \#\# Formatting Guidelines
>
> \- All output uses GitHub-flavored Markdown.
> \- Use a single main title (`#`) and clear primary subheadings (`##`).
> \- Keep paragraphs short (3–5 sentences, ≤150 words).
> \- Break large topics into labeled subsections.
> \- Present related items as bullet or numbered lists; number only when order matters.
> \- Always leave a blank line before and after each paragraph.
> \- Avoid bold or italic styling in body text unless explicitly requested.
> \- Use horizontal dividers (`---`) between major sections.
> \- Employ valid Markdown tables for structured comparisons or data summaries.
> \- Refrain from complex Unicode symbols; stick to simple characters.
> \- Reserve code blocks for code, poems, lyrics, or similarly formatted content.
> \- For mathematical expressions, use LaTeX outside of code blocks.

As the above suggests, Markdown's syntax is completely different from wikitext's: Markdown uses asterisks (\*) or underscores (\_) instead of single-quotes (') for bold and italic formatting, hash symbols (\#) instead of equals signs (=) for section headings, parentheses (()) instead of square brackets ([]) around URLs, and three symbols (---, \*\*\*, or \_\_\_) instead of four hyphens (----) for thematic breaks.

Even when they are told to do so explicitly, chatbots generally struggle to generate text using syntactically correct wikitext, as their training data lead to a drastically greater affinity for and fluency in Markdown. When told to "generate an article", a chatbot typically defaults to using Markdown for the generated output, which is preserved in clipboard text by the copy functions on some chatbot platforms. If instructed to generate content for Wikipedia, the chatbot might "realize" the need to generate Wikipedia-compatible code, and might include a message like Would you like me to  turn this into actual Wikipedia markup format (`wikitext`)? in its output. If the chatbot is told to proceed, the resulting syntax is often rudimentary, syntactically incorrect, or both. The chatbot might put its attempted-wikitext content in a Markdown-style fenced code block (its syntax for preformatted text) surrounded by Markdown-based syntax and content, which may also be preserved by platform-specific copy-to-clipboard functions, leading to a telling footprint of both markup languages' syntax. This might include the appearance of three backticks in the text, such as: `  ```wikitext `.

The presence of faulty wikitext syntax mixed with Markdown syntax is a strong indicator that content is LLM-generated, especially if in the form of a fenced Markdown code block. However, Markdown alone is not such a strong indicator. Software developers, researchers, technical writers, and experienced internet users frequently use Markdown in tools like Obsidian and GitHub, and on platforms like Reddit, Discord, and Slack. Some writing tools and apps, such as iOS Notes, Google Docs, and Windows Notepad, support Markdown editing or exporting. The increasing ubiquity of Markdown may also lead new editors to expect or assume Wikipedia to support Markdown by default.

**Examples**

  * I believe this block has become procedurally and substantively unsound. Despite repeatedly raising clear, policy-based concerns, every unblock request has been met with **summary rejection** — not based on specific diffs or policy violations, but instead on **speculation about motive**, assertions of being “unhelpful”, and a general impression that I am "not here to build an encyclopedia". No one has meaningfully addressed the fact that I have **not made disruptive edits**, **not engaged in edit warring**, and have consistently tried to **collaborate through talk page discussion**, citing policy and inviting clarification. Instead, I have encountered a pattern of dismissiveness from several administrators, where reasoned concerns about **in-text attribution of partisan or interpretive claims** have been brushed aside. Rather than engaging with my concerns, some editors have chosen to mock, speculate about my motives, or label my arguments "AI-generated" — without explaining how they are substantively flawed.
  * \- The Wikipedia entry does not explicitly mention the "Cyberhero League" being recognized as a winner of the World Future Society's BetaLaunch Technology competition, as detailed in the interview with THE FUTURIST (1). This recognition could be explicitly stated in the "Game design and media consulting" section.

Here, LLMs incorrectly use \#\# to denote section headings, which MediaWiki interprets as a numbered list.

> Geography
>
> Villers-Chief is situated in the Jura Mountains, in the eastern part of the Doubs department. 
>
> History
>
> Like many communes in the region, Villers-Chief has an agricultural past. 
>
> Administration
>
> Villers-Chief is part of the Canton of Valdahon and the Arrondissement of Pontarlier. 
>
> Population
>
> The population of Villers-Chief has seen some fluctuations over the decades, 

Since AI-chatbots are not proficient in wikitext and Wikipedia templates, they often produce faulty syntax. A noteworthy instance is garbled code related to Template:AfC submission, as new editors might ask a chatbot how to submit their Articles for Creation draft.

**Examples**

Note the badly malformed category link which appears to be a result of code that provides day information in the LLM's Markdown parser:

`[[Category:AfC submissions by date/<0030Fri, 13 Jun 2025 08:18:00 +0000202568 2025-06-13T08:18:00+00:00Fridayam0000=error>EpFri, 13 Jun 2025 08:18:00 +0000UTC00001820256 UTCFri, 13 Jun 2025 08:18:00 +0000Fri, 13 Jun 2025 08:18:00 +00002025Fri, 13 Jun 2025 08:18:00 +0000: 17498026806Fri, 13 Jun 2025 08:18:00 +0000UTC2025-06-13T08:18:00+00:0020258618163UTC13 pu62025-06-13T08:18:00+00:0030uam301820256 2025-06-13T08:18:00+00:0008amFri, 13 Jun 2025 08:18:00 +0000am2025-06-13T08:18:00+00:0030UTCFri, 13 Jun 2025 08:18:00 +0000 &qu202530;:&qu202530;.</0030Fri, 13 Jun 2025 08:18:00 +0000202568>June 2025|sandbox]]`

ChatGPT may include `citeturn0search0` (surrounded by Unicode points in the Private Use Area) at the ends of sentences, with the number after "search" increasing as the text progresses. These are places where the chatbot links to an external site, but a human pasting the conversation into Wikipedia has that link converted into placeholder code. This was first observed in February 2025.

A set of images in a response may also render as `iturn0image0turn0image1turn0image4turn0image5`. Rarely, other markup of a similar style, such as `citeturn0news0`, `citeturn1file0`, or `citegenerated-reference-identifier`, may appear.

**Examples**

  * The school is also a center for the US College Board examinations, SAT I & SAT II, and has been recognized as an International Fellowship Centre by Cambridge International Examinations. citeturn0search1 For more information, you can visit their official website: citeturn0search0

### Reference markup bugs: contentReference, oaicite, oai\_citation, attached\_file, grok\_card

Due to a bug, ChatGPT may add code in the form of `:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}` in place of links to references in output text. Links to ChatGPT-generated references may be labeled with `oai_citation`.

**Examples**

  * `:contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}`

  * 1.  **Ethnicity clarification**
        \- `:contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}`

    <!-- end list -->

      * `:contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18} :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}.`
      * `Denzil Ibbetson’s Panjab Castes classifies Sial as Rajputs :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}.`
      * `Historian’s blog notes: "The Sial are a clan of Parmara Rajputs…” :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}.`

    <!-- end list -->

    2.  `:contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}`
        \- `:contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}`

    > `:contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24} :contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}.`

  * #### 📌 Key facts needing addition or correction:

    1.  **Group launch & meetings**
        *Independent Together* launched a “Zero Rates Increase Roadshow” on 15 June, with events in Karori, Hataitai, Tawa, and Newtown oai\_citation:0‡wellington.scoop.co.nz.

    2.  **Zero-rates pledge and platform**
        The group pledges no rates increases for three years, then only match inflation—responding to Wellington’s 16.9% hike for 2024/25 oai\_citation:1‡en.wikipedia.org.

As of fall 2025, tags like `[attached_file:1]`, `[web:1]` have been seen at the end of sentences. This may be Perplexity-specific.

  * During his time as CEO, Philip Morris’s reputation management and media relations brought together business and news interests in ways that later became controversial, with effects still debated in contemporary regulatory and legal discussions.`[attached_file:1]`

Though Grok-generated text is rare compared to other chatbots, it may sometimes include XML-styled grok\_card tags after citations.

  * Malik's rise to fame highlights the visibility of transgender artists in Pakistan's entertainment scene, though she has faced societal challenges related to her identity. `<grok-card data-id="e8ff4f" data-type="citation_card">`

"contentReference" OR "oaicite" OR "oai\_citation"

#### attribution and attributableIndex

ChatGPT may add JSON-formatted code at the end of sentences in the form of `({"attribution":{"attributableIndex":"X-Y"}})` , with X and Y being increasing numeric indices.

**Examples**

  * `^[Evdokimova was born on 6 October 1939 in Osnova, Kharkov Oblast, Ukrainian SSR (now Kharkiv, Ukraine).]({"attribution":{"attributableIndex":"1009-1"}}) ^[She graduated from the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography (VGIK) in 1963, where she studied under Mikhail Romm.]({"attribution":{"attributableIndex":"1009-2"}}) oai_citation:0‡IMDb oai_citation:1‡maly.ru`
  * `Patrick Denice & Jake Rosenfeld, Les syndicats et la rémunération non syndiquée aux États-Unis, 1977–2015, ‘‘Sociological Science’’ (2018).]({“attribution”:{“attributableIndex”:“3795-0”}})`

### Non-existent or out-of-place categories and "see also" pages

LLMs may hallucinate non-existent categories, sometimes for generic concepts that seem likeplausible category titles (or SEO keywords), and sometimes because their training set includes obsolete and renamed categories. These will appear as red links. You may also find category redirects, such as the longtime spammer favorite Category:Entrepreneurs. Sometimes, broken categories may be deleted by reviewers, so if you suspect a page may be LLM-generated, it may be worth checking earlier revisions.

Pay attention to blue links under see also headers as well. LLM-generated "see also" sections often tend to fill them up (to at least three links) seemingly out of obligation. If a new page/draft on some startup links to a broad term like Financial technology in its see-also section, that's a bit suspicious.

Of course, none of this section should be treated as a hard-and-fast rule. New users are unlikely to know about Wikipedia's style guidelines for these sections, and returning editors may be used to old categories that have since been deleted.

**Examples**

  * `[[Category:American hip hop musicians]]`

rather than

  * `[[Category:American hip-hop musicians]]`

### Non-existent templates

LLMs often hallucinate non-existent templates (especially plausible-sounding types of infoboxes) and template parameters. These will also appear as red links, and non-existent template parameters in existing templates have no effect. LLMs may also use templates that were deleted after their knowledge cutoff date.

**Examples**

`{{Infobox ancient population | name = Gangetic Hunter-Gatherer (GHG) | image = [[File:GHG_reconstruction.png|250px]] | caption = Artistic reconstruction of a Gangetic Hunter-Gatherer male, based on Mesolithic skeletal data from the Ganga Valley | regions = Ganga Valley (from Haryana to Bengal, between the Vindhyas and Himalayas) | period = Mesolithic–Early Neolithic (10,000–5,000 BCE) | descendants = Gangetic peoples, Indus Valley Civilisation, South Indian populations | archaeological_sites = Bhimbetka, Sarai Nahar Rai, Mahadaha, Jhusi, Chirand }}`

rather than

`{{Infobox archaeological culture | name = Gangetic Hunter-Gatherer (GHG) | map = [[File:GHG_reconstruction.png|250px]] | mapcaption = Artistic reconstruction of a Gangetic Hunter-Gatherer male, based on Mesolithic skeletal data from the Ganga Valley | region = Ganga Valley (from Haryana to Bengal, between the Vindhyas and Himalayas) | period = Mesolithic–Early Neolithic (10,000–5,000 BCE) | followedby = Gangetic peoples, Indus Valley Civilisation, South Indian populations | majorsites = Bhimbetka, Sarai Nahar Rai, Mahadaha, Jhusi, Chirand }}`

### Broken external links

If a new article or draft has multiple citations with external links, and several of them are broken (e.g., returning 404 errors), this is a strong sign of an AI-generated page, particularly if the dead links are not found in website archiving sites like Internet Archive or Archive Today. Most links become broken over time, but these factors make it unlikely that the link was ever real.

### Invalid DOI and ISBNs

A checksum can be used to verify ISBNs. An invalid checksum is a very likely sign that an ISBN is incorrect, and citation templates display a warningif so. Similarly, DOIs are more resistant to link rot than regular hyperlinks. Unresolvable DOIs and invalid ISBNs can be indicators of hallucinatedreferences.

Related are DOIs that point to entirely unrelated articles and general book citations without pages. This passage, for example, was generated by ChatGPT.

> Ohm's Law is a fundamental principle in the field of electrical engineering and physics that states the current passing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points, provided the temperature remains constant. Mathematically, it is expressed as V=IR, where V is the voltage, I is the current, and R is the resistance. The law was formulated by German physicist Georg Simon Ohm in 1827, and it serves as a cornerstone in the analysis and design of electrical circuits. Ohm’s Law applies to many materials and components that are "ohmic," meaning their resistance remains constant regardless of the applied voltage or current. However, it does not hold for non-linear devices like diodes or transistors.

The book references appear valid – a book on electric circuits would likely have information about Ohm's law – but without the page number, that citation is not useful for verifying the claims in the prose. Worse, both Proceedings of the IEEEcitations are completely made up. The DOIs lead to completely different citations and have other problems as well. For instance, C. L. Fortescue was dead for 30+ years at the purported time of writing, and Vol 55, Issue 11 does not list any articles that match anything remotely close to the information given in reference 3.

### Incorrect or unconventional use of references

AI tools may have been prompted to include references, and make an attempt to do so as Wikipedia expects, but fail with some key implementation details or stand out when compared with conventions.

In the below example, note the incorrect attempt at re-using references. The tool used here was not capable of searching for non-confabulated sources (as it was done the day before Bing Deep Search launched) but nonetheless found one real reference. The syntax for re-using the references was incorrect.

In this case, the Smith, R. J. source – being the "third source" the tool presumably generated the link 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3' (which has a PMID reference of 3) – is also completely irrelevant to the body of the article. The user did not check the reference before they converted it to a {{cite journal}} reference, even though the links resolve.

The LLM in this case has diligently included the incorrect re-use syntax after every single full stop.

> For over thirty years, computers have been utilized in the rehabilitation of individuals with brain injuries. Initially, researchers delved into the potential of developing a "prosthetic memory." However, by the early 1980s, the focus shifted towards addressing brain dysfunction through repetitive practice. Only a few psychologists were developing rehabilitation software for individuals with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), resulting in a scarcity of available programs. Cognitive rehabilitation specialists opted for commercially available computer games that were visually appealing, engaging, repetitive, and entertaining, theorizing their potential remedial effects on neuropsychological dysfunction.

ChatGPT may add the UTM parameter `utm_source=openai` or, in edits prior to August 2025, `utm_source=chatgpt.com` to URLs that it is using as sources. Other LLMs, such as Gemini or Claude, use UTM parameters less often.

Note: While this does definitively prove ChatGPT's involvement, it doesn't prove, on its own, that ChatGPT also generated the writing. Some editors use AI tools to find citations for existing text; this will be apparent in the edit history.

**Examples**

  * Following their marriage, Burgess and Graham settled in Cheshire, England, where Burgess serves as the head coach for the Warrington Wolves rugby league team. 
  * Vertex AI documentation and blog posts describe watermarking, verification workflow, and configurable safety filters (for example, person‑generation controls and safety thresholds). (cloud.google.com)

    insource:"utm\_source=openai"

### Named references declared in references section but unused in article body

**Examples**

See these diffs for examples. The problematic references appear as parser errors in the reflist.

AI tools may abruptly stop generating content, for example if they predict the end of text sequence (appearing as `<|endoftext|>`) next. Also, the number of tokens that a single response has is usually limited, and further responses require the user to select "continue generating".

This method is not foolproof, as a malformed copy/paste from one's local computer can also cause this. It may also indicate a copyright violationrather than the use of an LLM.

### Sudden shift in writing style

A sudden shift in an editor's writing style, such as unexpectedly flawless grammar compared to their other communication, may indicate the use of AI tools.

Combining formal and casual writing styles is not exclusive to AI, but may be considered a sign.

Using more formal prose in some writing may simply be a matter of code switching.

### Sudden shift in English variety use

A mismatch of user location, national ties of the topic to a variety of English, and the variety of English used may indicate the use of AI tools. A human writer from India writing about an Indian university would probably not use American English; however, LLM outputs use American English by default, unless prompted otherwise. Note that non-native English speakers tend to mix up English varieties, and such signs should raise suspicion only if there is a sudden and complete shift in an editor's English variety use.

### Overwhelmingly verbose edit summaries

AI-generated edit summaries are often unusually long, written as formal, first-person paragraphs without abbreviations, and/or conspicuously itemize Wikipedia's conventions.

  * Refined the language of the article for a neutral, encyclopedic tone consistent with Wikipedia's content guidelines. Removed promotional wording, ensured factual accuracy, and maintained a clear, well-structured presentation. Updated sections on history, coverage, challenges, and recognition for clarity and relevance. Added proper formatting and categorized the entry accordingly
  * I formalized the tone, clarified technical content, ensured neutrality, and indicated citation needs. Historical narratives were streamlined, allocation details specified with regulatory references, propagation explanations made reader-friendly, and equipment discussions focused on availability and regulatory compliance, all while adhering to encyclopedic standards.
  * **Concise edit summary:** Improved clarity, flow, and readability of the plot section; reduced redundancy and refined tone for better encyclopedic style.

### "Submission statements" in AFC drafts

This one is specific to drafts submitted by Articles for Creation. At least one LLM tends to insert "submission statements" supposedly intended for reviewers that supposedly explain why the subject is notable and why the draft meets Wikipedia guidelines. Of course, all this actually does is let reviewers know that the draft is LLM-generated, and should be declined or speedied without a second thought.

> Reviewer note (for AfC): This draft is a neutral and well-sourced biography of Portuguese public manager Jorge Patrão. All references are from independent, reliable sources (Público, Diário de Notícias, Jornal de Negócios, RTP, O Interior, Agência Lusa) covering his public career and cultural activity. It meets WP:RS and WP:BLP standards and demonstrates clear notability per WP:NBIO through: – Presidency of Serra da Estrela Tourism Region (1998–2013); – Presidency of Parkurbis – Covilhã Science and Technology Park; – Founding role in Rede de Judiarias de Portugal (member of the Council of Europe’s European Routes of Jewish Heritage); – Authorship of the book "1677 – A Fábrica d’El-Rei"; – Founder/curator of the Beatriz de Luna Art Collection (Old Master focus). There is also a Portuguese version of this article at pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge\_Patrão. Thank you for your review. --\>

### Pre-placed maintenance templates

Occasionally a new editor creates a draft that includes an AFC review template already set to "declined". The template is also devoid of content with no reviewer reasoning given. The LLM apparently offers to add an AFC submission template to the draft, and then provides something like `{{AfC submission|d}}`, in which the "d" parameter pre-declines the draft by substituting `{{AfC submission/declined}}`. The draft's contribution history reveals that this template was inserted at some point by the draft's creator. Invariably the creator then asks on a help page why the draft was declined with no feedback. The presence of a content-free "submission declined" header is a strong indicator that the draft was LLM-generated.

LLMs have been known to create pages that already have maintenance templates that shouldn't plausibly be there, including maintence tags and incorrect protection templates.

  * `{{Short description|French inventor and engineer (1861–1942)}}`
  * `{{pp|small=yes}}`
  * `{{pp-move}}`
  * `{{Use American English|date=September 2022}}`
  * `{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2025}}`

### Age of text relative to ChatGPT launch

ChatGPT was launched to the public on November 30, 2022. Although OpenAI had similarly powerful LLMs before then, they were paid services and not easily accessible or known to lay people. ChatGPT experienced extreme growth immediately on launch.

It is very unlikely that any particular text added to Wikipedia prior to November 30, 2022 was generated by an LLM. If an edit was made before this date, AI use can be safely ruled out for that revision. While some older text may display some of the AI signs given in this list, and even convincingly appear to have been AI-generated, the vastness of Wikipedia allows for these rare coincidences.

### Ability to explain one's own editorial choices

Editors should be able to explain why they made one or more edits or mistakes. For example, if an editor inserts a URL that appears fabricated, you can ask how the mix-up occurred instead of jumping to conclusions. If they can supply the correct link and explain it as a human error (perhaps a typo), or share the relevant passage from the real source, that points to an ordinary human error.

### Ineffective indicators

False accusations of AI use can drive away new editors and foster an atmosphere of suspicion. Before claiming AI was used, consider if Dunning–Kruger effect and confirmation bias is clouding your judgement. Here are several somewhat commonly used indicators that are ineffective in LLM detection—and may even indicate the opposite.

  * **Perfect grammar:** While modern LLMs are known for their high grammatical proficiency, many editors are also skilled writers or come from professional writing backgrounds. (See also the section on sudden shift in English variety use.) Some may alternatively interpret AI as using "bad grammar", yet the prose may merely adhere to different prescriptions or stylistic principles, such as whether singular indefinite "they" is acceptable.
  * **Combination of casual and formal registers, or language that sounds both "clinical" and "emotional":** This may indicate the casual writing of a person in a technical field, such as computer science. It may also indicate youth, a preference for mixed registers, playfulness, or neurodivergence.
  * **"Bland" or "robotic" prose:** By default, modern LLMs tend toward effusive and verbose prose, as detailed above; while this tendency is formulaic, it may not scan as "robotic" to those unfamiliar with AI writing.
  * **"Fancy," "academic," or unusual words:** While LLMs disproportionately favor certain words and phrases, many of which are long and have difficult readability scores, the correlation does not extend to all "fancy," academic, or "advanced"-sounding prose. Low-frequency and "unusual" words are also less likely to show up in AI-generated writing as they are statistically less common, unless they are proper nouns directly related to the topic.
  * **Letter-like writing (in isolation):** Although many talk page messages written with salutations, valedictions, subject lines, and other formalities after 2023 tend to appear AI-generated, letters and emails have conventionally been written in such ways longbefore modern LLMs existed. Human editors (particularly newer editors) may format their talk page comments similarly for various reasons, such as being more accustomed to formal communication, posting as part of a school assignment that requires such at one, or simply mistaking the talk page for email. AI-generated talk page messages tend to have other tells, such as vertical lists, placeholders, or abrupt cutoffs.
  * **Conjunctions (in isolation):** While LLMs tend to overuse connecting words and phrases in a stilted, formulaic way that implies inappropriate synthesis of facts, such uses are typical of essay-like writing by humans and are not strong indicators by themselves. While many people are taught beginning a sentence with a coordinating conjunction is nonstandard (or at least bad style), such usage has precedence and is accepted by many style guides.
  * **Bizarre wikitext:** While LLMs may hallucinate templates or generate wikitext code with invalid syntax for reasons explained in the section on the use of Markdown, they are not likely to generate content with certain random-seeming, "inexplicable" errors and artifacts (excluding the ones listed on this page in the section on markup). Bizarrely placed HTML tags like `<span>` are more indicative of poorly programmed browser extensions or a known bug with Wikipedia's content translation tool. Misplaced syntax like `''Catch-22 i''s a satirical novel.` (rendered as "Catch-22 is a satirical novel.") are more indicative of mistakes in VisualEditor, where such errors are harder to notice than in source editing.
